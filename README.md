## About The Project

The Sovereign AI Tracker is your global tracker for a critical technological and geopolitical shift: the rise of national AI initiatives. As AI models become the new "information stack"‚Äîshaping culture, education, and national security‚Äîreliance on external AI capabilities creates significant vulnerabilities. This repository documents how nations worldwide are building their own "AI factories," aiming to embed their unique languages, values, and strategic interests directly into the foundational AI that will define their digital future.

Understanding this trend is vital. It's not just about technological independence; it's about who controls the lens through which information is processed and realities are shaped. Whether you're in tech, policy, research, or simply an informed citizen, this list provides insight into how the world is preparing for an AI-driven era where digital and cultural sovereignty are paramount.
