          The Sovereign AI Tracker is a project by Nicolas Metallo that documents the rise of national AI initiatives around the world. The list tracks how countries are building their own AI capabilities to embed their unique languages, values, and strategic interests into foundation models. It serves as a global tracker for the technological and geopolitical shifts in AI sovereignty.

            The Sovereign AI Tracker is your global tracker for a critical technological and geopolitical shift: the rise of national AI initiatives. 
            As AI models become the new "information stack"‚Äîshaping culture, education, and national security‚Äîreliance on external AI capabilities 
            creates significant vulnerabilities. This repository documents how nations worldwide are building their own "AI factories," aiming to embed 
            their unique languages, values, and strategic interests directly into the foundational AI that will define their digital future.

            Understanding this trend is vital. It's not just about technological independence; it's about who controls the lens through which 
            information is processed and realities are shaped. Whether you're in tech, policy, research, or simply an informed citizen, this list 
            provides insight into how the world is preparing for an AI-driven era where digital and cultural sovereignty are paramount.
